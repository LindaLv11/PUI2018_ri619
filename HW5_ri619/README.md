## README for HW5_ri619 


### Assignment 1:
### __________________________________________________________________________________

   On this assigment, we analyzed the hypothesis and data cleaning submitted by a random classmate. I was assigned Junjie Cai's work where they hypothesized that ride duration does not change from night to day.
   
   
### Assignment 2:
### __________________________________________________________________________________


   Assignment 2 called for us to find research papers on Plos One that utilized some of the statistical tests we have been learning in class. I worked with Sarah June Sachs and Andrew Hill on this part of the assignment. I did research into Path Analysis, Sarah found a paper that used ANOVA and Andrew found a paper using Logistic Regression. The table and corresponding plots are below. 
   

### Assignment 3:
### __________________________________________________________________________________


   Assignment 3 asked us to reproduce analysis done into the NYC Post-Prison Employment program. The main crux of the assignment was to learn how to utilize two types of tests, Z-test and Chi Square test. The two questions we looked at were "the difference in rates of former prisoners employed in a CEO position with/without the program" and "the difference in recidivism rates for former prisoners within 1-3 years of release"
   


### Assignment 4:
### __________________________________________________________________________________

   Using Citibike data, in this assignment we ask two questions, "Is there a difference in trip duration between night and day" and (As EC) "Is there a difference in age between rides starting in Manhattan and in Brooklyn". For each question, we must use the following tests: K-S test, Pearson's test, and Spearman's test. In all cases, these tests determine the similarities between two datasets.

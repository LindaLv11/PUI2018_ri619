## PUI2018_ri619/HW4

This repository contains all assignments for HW4 in PUI2018. 

### Assignment1_ri619: 
  Using different distributions to help explain the law of large numbers or the Central Limit Theorem. 
  The chosen distributions were Normal (Gaussian), Poisson, Binomial, Chi Square, and Laplace. In each distribution, it became clear that as the distribution sizes were increased, the sample mean would trend towards the given mean.

### Assignment2_ri619: 
  Pull data from the CitiBike database and come up with a Null hypothesis about ridership trends. My hypothesis focuses on different ridership levels at nightttime and daytime for male and female riders. The null hypothesis states that the difference between male and female ridership at night is larger than the difference during the day.

### Assignment3_ri619:
  Complete Lab4 to calculate the Z-statistic for commute times for a new bus route versus the old bus route. The Z-statistic provides the user with a value that helps determine the probability of getting such sample values, and a basis for rejecting/not the null hypothesis at a given significance value.

# PUI2018 HW 7


## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis. 

In this assignment we were to take Census data and LinkNYC data and overlay them on top of each other to get a better understanding of broadband access and access points in NYC. 

All of the data cleaning was done using Pandas and GeoPandas and involved much of what we learned in Chris's two lectures. Additionally we learned how to pull data from the US Census and the various information they take.

## HW8

### Assignment 1

----> ![main plot](Manhattan_map.png)

----> The plot above shows the number of taxi complaints in 2009 per sidewalk cafe license by zipcode in Manhattan. The large increase of complaints per cafe in Midtown can possibly be attributed to the raw amount of taxi rides in Midtown coupled with the comparitevely low number of cafes (as this is primarily a business district).
